    <div>
      <h3>Colours</h3>
        <p>Primary blue colours are used for the gradient background, the black and white colours are used for typography through the app.</p>
        <p>The secondary colour is used for the CTA buttons.</p>
      <div>

    <div>
      <h3>Typography</h3>
        <p>Didot is used for the logo. It has an elegant, expensive look user can trust. It is serious yet with the rounded letters are welcoming.</p>
        <p>eBalance</p>
        <p>Quicksand is simple, friendly and easy to read. It is used for the headers and body text. Its options are regular/medium and bold.</p>
        <p>“A finance app you can trust.”</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Image Style</h3>
        <p>Adding colourful dashboard, with a rounder shape makes the app more friendly. Categories and its colour codes make it easier to understand and compare how much the user spent and saved.</p>
        <p>Reaching the goal will reward the user, inspire and motivate them to keep going. Using vector images will spice up the app and fun to use.</p>

    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Writing Style</h3>
        <p>As the app is mainly for the younger generation who isn’t confident with their financials, the tone of the context should be friendly, supportive, clear and easy to understand. We do not want to turn users away with financial jargon.</p>
        <p>In the same time it has to be optimistic and motivating with clear instructions that helps users to achieve their goals.</p>

      <h2>User flows</h2>
        <p> I started the design process with 3 user stories for the user flows and generated a single user flow diagram. Once I have done this I started to sketch the low-fidelity wireframes and put some ideas on paper. It was challenging as I haven’t designed a budgeting app before, but that’s the beauty in it, to get out of our comfort zone and see what we are capable of.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>User story</h4>
        <p>As a money-saver, I need to be able to input information on the money I am receiving and spending (and on what), so that I can see an overview of my finances.</p>
        <p>Entry point: Loading screen</p>
        <p>Success criteria: categories</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Loading screen</li>
          <li>Sign up</li>
          <li>Create a profile</li>
          <li>Add bankcard(s) so the user can monitor the money going in and out without manually entering the amount</li>
          <li>Manage the categories of spending so it will be easier to see where the money goes</li>
          <li>View the spendings by categories on the Dashboard</li>
        </ol>

      <h4>User story</h4>

      <p>Before I dive into the design process deeper, I prefer to do a user test so I know how my design works and what I have to do to make it better.</p>

      <h2>User tests</h2>

    <div>
      <h4>Scenario</h4>
        <p>You are creating an account and setting up your saving goals. Which steps would you take to accomplish this task?</p>
        <p>Hi,
        Thank you for agreeing to help me with my user test! As a refresher, this user test is meant to measure the appropriateness of my design and is in no way a test of your ability. Your feedback will help me to improve my work and understanding of a user’s experience.</p>
        <p>This is your task: You are creating an account and setting up your saving goals.
        Which steps would you take to accomplish this task?</p>
        <p>The link to my prototype is</p>
        <a href="https://melinda76983.invisionapp.com/console/share/731WP4IOAF/496740352" target="_blank">InVision</a>
        <p>If you agree, I will record the user test for the purpose of note taking. Please spend no more than 5-10 minutes working through the task using the prototype and describe your thoughts and actions out loud as well, so I can better understand your experience. I may reach out to you again if I have follow-up questions.
        Thank you again! I really appreciate your time and help! Let me know openly if you have any questions or face any problem.</p>
        <p>Take care,
        Melinda</p>

      <p>After completing the user tests I made the suggested changes and finalised the design.</p>
      <a href="https://melinda76983.invisionapp.com/console/share/5Y1WXCYEHC/496785886" target="_blank">InVision</a>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>After this point I continued the design with colours I already set at the beginning of the branding.
      The colours worked well, but I had a few variations before I ended up with the final design.
      I have designed a responsive web app previously for the recipe app that went well (looking back now) as I had many Information and design elements to display on the screen.
      On this occasion as I started the design on the small screen and my mind was set for it. Then I continued on the larger screens and it caused me a little difficulty to reset my mind and think differently to complete the design. I am happy with the result and the journey that taught me to accomplish this.</p>
